## Development

### Development setup

- Clone the repository
- make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
- insert firebase config in `.env`
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server


### Development workflow

- We work on the `develop` branch.
- Always pull the latest changes from `develop` before starting new work.
- Create a new **feature branch** from `develop` for each new feature or fix.
- Once your work is ready, open a **pull request** from your feature branch to `develop`.
- The `main` branch is connected to Continuous Deployment (CD) â€“ pushing to `main` will automatically deploy the app to Netlify.
